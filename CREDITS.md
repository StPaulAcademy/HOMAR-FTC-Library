The HOMAR library is a product of the [Spartan Robotics](https://sites.google.com/spa.edu/spartan-robotics/) team, which represents [St. Paul Academy and Summit School (SPA)](https://www.spa.edu) in the [*FIRST* Tech Challenge](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc). A sincere thanks to SPA for their support of the robotics program.

## Acknowledgements
We’d like to thank the people behind the following sources of information that helped us with the library:
* **The [FTCVision library](https://github.com/lasarobotics/FTCVision), created by [LASA Robotics](http://lasarobotics.org/)** — this library showed us how we could create our own library as a Gradle module and distribute it as a Git submodule
## Helpful Feedback
Thank you to these HOMAR users who provided us feedback so we could improve the library:
* An FTC team member who led us to realize that our non-Git installation instructions were incorrect
* Someone from another FTC team who led us to realize that our tank drivetrain positioning formula was incorrect
